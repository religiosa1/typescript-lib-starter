# TypeScript library starter

Minimalistic typescript library starter. Loosely based on [alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter](https://github.com/alexjoverm/typescript-library-starter).

### Usage

Just transpiling with tsc:

```bash
npx degit religiosa1/typescript-lib-starter YOURFOLDERNAME
cd YOURFOLDERNAME
npm install
```

Fill in --libraryname-- in the package.json and your name and email in the package.json and LICENSE files.

### Features
 - UMD and es modules transpilation following the the [standard convention](http://2ality.com/2017/04/setting-up-multi-platform-packages.html)
 - Bundling, minifaction and tree-shaking with **[rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)** and **[terser](https://terser.org/)**
 - Tests, coverage and interactive watch mode using **[Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/)**
 - **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** for linting
 - **Docs generation** to using **[TypeDoc](http://typedoc.org/)**
 - Type declaration `(*.d.ts)` files generation
 - [Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) stub

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import myLib from 'mylib'
```

### NPM scripts

- `build`: Build minified es and umd versions and generate type declarations.
- `watch`: Run bundling without minimizations in the watch mode, rebundling on every file change in src.
- `docs`: Generate docs,
- `test`: run tests,
- `clean`: remove all generated files -- dist, docs, coverage reports. (except node_modules)

#### Additional stuff

- `transpile`: Transpile all ts files into corresponding js files in dist dir.
- `bundle`: Same as build, but without type declarations.
- `declarations`: Only emit declarations


### Slash imports
If you need to provide some slashed imports

```javascript
import something from 'mylib/dist/something'
```

Change the build script in package.json:

```bash
run-p transpile bundle
```

In this way umd modules transpiled by tsc would be accessible in the dist folder.

### Excluding peerDependencies

On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs](https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies) how to do that.

Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.js`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.

### FAQ

#### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?

TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features (`class`, `let`, `async/await`...), but not on functional features (`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...), . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) or [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) (which extends `core-js`).

For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:

```javascript
import "core-js/fn/array/find"
import "core-js/fn/string/includes"
import "core-js/fn/promise"
...
```
